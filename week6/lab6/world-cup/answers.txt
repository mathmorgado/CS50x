Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

    With 10 simulations, compared to larger amounts of simulations, it proved incorrect in terms of the accuracy of the probability of certain teams winning, as well as the number of countries likely to win the World Cup.

    With 100 simulations, it proved to be incorrect in terms of the accuracy of the probability of winning.

    However, from 1000 simulations onwards, the accuracy tends to remain very similar, varying greatly from simulation to simulation. And from 10,000 simulations onwards, the variation is minimal, becoming irrelevant.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10.000

    After 10,000 simulations, the accuracy of the winning probabilities becomes very precise, and the difference between the execution time of 1,000 and 10,000 simulations is small and compensated for by the accuracy.
